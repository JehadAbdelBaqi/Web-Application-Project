## Creating the Repo interface and Service classes.

We create a Repo interface which extends from JpaRespository. JpaRepository is a JPA (Java Persistence API) specific extension of Repository. It contains the full API of CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository. So it contains API for basic CRUD operations and also API for pagination and sorting.

You then name your file and click next.

Finally, you select the dependancies - usually when you have a new project and havent had any previous then the selected dependacies aren't there - you simply search for them and include the ones you want.
